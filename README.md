# SafeRL-Power-System
The repository is for Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) in power system applications, based on the paper [*A Review of Safe Reinforcement Learning Methods for Modern Power Systems*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11074719), where we explore various safe RL baselines, benchmarks, applications, and real-world deployments. 

If any papers are missing from this list, or if any authors prefer not to have their work included here, please feel free to contact [tong.su.th@dartmouth.edu](mailto:tong.su.th@dartmouth.edu). (This repository is under active development. We welcome and appreciate any constructive comments and suggestions.)
